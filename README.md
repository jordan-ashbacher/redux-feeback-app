# Project Name

React/Redux Feedback App

## Description

_Duration: 48 Hour Challenge_

This application is created using React as a reflection/feedback form. Each page has it's own slider that allow users to input their current feedback values for categories like, feeling, understanding, and support. The use of React components makes it easy to replicate and more sliders can be added if the admin is looking for additional feedback. The last page has a text input where users can input a comment although it is not required. After all the input forms are completed the user is directed to a review page where they can confirm the values they selected. Users are also able to edit their submission by clicking the edit button and selecting the category they'd like to edit. Once submit is clicked the database is updated with the feedback data and the user is directed to a confirmation page where they can choose to leave new feedback and begin the process anew. An admin page is also accessible by including admin in the url. This page displays all the submitted feedback. The admin has the ability to delete the feedback from the database if they so choose.
